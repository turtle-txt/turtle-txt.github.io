            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I’m Sreelal Ramadas, a passionate cybersecurity enthusiast with a diverse background that bridges technology and problem-solving. With training in network security, steganography, BadUSB, Evil Twin attacks, and SQL, I thrive on understanding and addressing the complexities of the digital world. My journey into the world of technology is not just about theory; I actively create and experiment with tools like the ones I’m developing in Kali Linux and Python to extract meaningful data from real-world scenarios, such as lottery results, and scan websites for vulnerabilities.

From working in customer service and hardware support to tackling network engineering challenges, I’ve gained hands-on experience in solving problems that require both technical skill and creativity. I believe in continuously learning, adapting, and pushing the boundaries of what technology can do. As I continue to grow in the cybersecurity field, I’m driven by a desire to make systems more secure and to build solutions that are both innovative and practical.

When I’m not diving into tech, you’ll find me trading stocks, exploring Linux fundamentals, or studying new cybersecurity concepts. Every project I take on is an opportunity to learn, innovate, and make an impact in the digital world.</p>
